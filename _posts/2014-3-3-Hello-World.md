The team behind Project LEAN needed a place, where we could post updates and stuff happening in the process of making this project awesome. 

We choose a very lightweight and simple platform. Github Pages, powered by Jekyll, which is plain static pages with content.

We'll try to provide regular release notes and updates on the project.
